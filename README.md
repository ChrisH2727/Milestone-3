<span id="isotope"></span>

![Portfolio website](readmeimg/isotope.jpg)

A university physics faculty is required to maintain stock of radioactive sources for teaching and research purposes.

While individule radioactive sources do not pose a risk to health of students using them, collectively and in the wrong hands they could become a danger to the student community and security risk.

It is therefore crutial that the scientific staff contol student or accademic staff usage of these radioactive sources.

<h1>1. User experience (UX)</h1>

<span id="ux-goals"></span>

### 1.1 Project goals 

- Develop a full-stack application that allows users to access a common dataset.
- Develop a full-stack site that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB.

- Creat a website where students and accademic staff can:
    - register and be approved to use radioactive sources
    - see and select a radioactive source from a list of available radioactive sources and submit a request to use one.

- Create a website through which scientific staff can:
    - manage radioactive source allocation to students and accademic staff
    - Create Read Update and Delete radioactive source characteristic details
     
- Creating a website that is:
    - Simple to understand and easy to navigate
    - Presents different levels of access to information for students/accademics and scientific staff.

<span id="ux-stories"></span>

### 1.2 User stories

**First time user goals:**

1. As a first time user, I want to be able to register with the application so that I am authorised to use the radioactive sources available in the faculty.

**Existing user goals:** 
 
1. As a user, I want to login and out of the web application securely

2. As a user, I want to view my registration profil.

3. As a user, I want to change my password, department and research group.

4. As a user, I want to view all the sources that I have loaned so that I can determine which ones I need to return.

5. As a user, I want to search for different types of sources that I will need for my research work in the future and view the results.

6. As an user, I want the present activity of the source to be calculated and displayed so that I can confirm that it will be suitable for my work.

7. As a user, I want to create a request for a sources of the required type from the inventory of available sources and have my request approved.

8. As a user I want to delete my request prior to its approval if I change my mind regarding the type of source.

**Admin user goals:**

1. As an admin user, I want to approve user each registration request so that I can ensure that the correct Health and Safety briefing has been given.

2. As an admin user, I want to view the registration status of all other users.

3. As an admin user, I want to update the access rights of  other users to that of admin to create deputies

4. As an admin user, I want to suspend a user account to prevent a user from loaning more sources.

5. As an admin user, I want to permanently delete as user acccount, but only if the user has returned all loaned sources

6. As an admin user, I want to view the technical characteristices of all sources so that users can be advised on their selection.

7. As an admin user, I want to view the location of all sources on inventory to satisfy a security audit.

8. As an admin user, I want to create a new entry source entry with the same or different technical charateristc but with a unique serial number.

9. As an admin user, I want to update the technical characteristics of an existing source if there is an error either by selecting from the full inventory or by searching on the serial number.

10. As an admin user, I want to delete a source from the inventory either by selecting from the full inventory or by searching on the serial number, but only if that source has been returned to the inventory.

11. As an admin user, I want to view all the isotope types available

12. As an admin user I want to add isotope types and its respective half life to the list.

13. As an admin user I want to update information assocaited with an isotope.

14. As an admin user I want to delete isotope types, but only if all sources of that isotope type are not on loan.

15. As an admin user, I want to view the full history of source loans so that I can spot any patterns.

16. As an admin user, I want to view how many times a source has been loaned by isotope type so that I can dispose of sources that are not being loaned.

17. As an admin user, I want to view how user logins there have been on a given date so that I can assses how the service is being used.  

**Goals that would appeal to Scientists:**

1. As a scientist, I want to see information presented in a tabular form where possible so that I can spot patterns in the data.

**Goals that would appeal to the general user:** 

1. As a user or admin user, I may want to view information on small screen width devices which do not lend themselves to displaying data in tabular form.

2. As a user or admin user, I want to confirm any delete action that results in the permanet removal of information from the data base.

### 1.3 Design 

- #### Colour scheme 

    The three colours that are used for the radioactive inventory website chosen not to detract from the important information that is presented.

    - **Light yellow** is used for the background to provide contrast for the blue **[Marterialize](https://materializecss.com/cards.html)** cards 

    - **Mid Blue** is used for the header and footer. 

    - **Light Blue** is used for the card panels and these are further inset with **white** cards panels to provide a heading for the page of section and to focus in on the form or table dispayed. 

- #### Fonts

    Sans serif and cursive are the fallbacks in case the main font isnâ€™t being imported to the site correctly. 

- #### Icons

    In the project, icons are used that are provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). The Icons that are used have functional purposes such as the hamburger menu and social media icons. 

- #### Images

    The images used are provided by [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/).

- #### Tables

    As this website will predominently be utilised by individual from the scientific community, considerable use is made of tables. Scientists like to see information in tables so that they can see patterns of date.  **[Cloud Tables](https://cloudtables.com/)** provides an excelent free to use JQuery plugin for this purpose.

- #### Collapsibles

    Unfortunately tables do not render well on smaller screen devices and so use is made of the **[Collaspible](https://materializecss.com/collapsible.html)** provided by **Materialize**
