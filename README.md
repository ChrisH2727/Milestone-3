<span id="isotope"></span>

![Portfolio website](readmeimg/isotope.jpg)

A university physics faculty is required to maintain stock of radioactive sources for teaching and research purposes.

While individule radioactive sources do not pose a risk to health of students using them, collectively and in the wrong hands they could become a danger to the student community and security risk.

It is therefore crutial that the scientific staff contol student or academic staff usage of these radioactive sources.

8. As a user, I want to create a request for a sources of the required type from the inventory of available sources and have my request approved. Note, that it is assumed that accademic staff will know the characteristics of the source that they are searching for. 

9. As a user I want to delete my request prior to its approval if I change my mind regarding the type of source.

**Admin user goals:**

1. As an admin user I want a simple to setup procedure to permit others users to access the application.  

2. As an admin user, I want to approve user each registration request so that I can ensure that the correct Health and Safety briefing has been given.

3. As an admin user, I want to view the registration status of all other users.

4. As an admin user, I want to update the access rights of  other users to that of admin to create deputies

5. As an admin user, I want to suspend a user account to prevent a user from loaning more sources.

6. As an admin user, I want to permanently delete as user acccount, but only if the user has returned all loaned sources

7. As an admin user, I want to view the technical characteristices of all sources so that users can be advised on their selection.

8. As an admin user, I want to view the location of all sources on inventory to satisfy a security audit.

9. As an admin user, I want to create a new entry source entry with the same or different technical charateristc but with a unique serial number.

**Goals that would appeal to Scientists:**

1. As a scientist, I want to see information presented in a tabular form where possible so that I can spot patterns in the data.

**Goals that would appeal to the general user:** 

1. As a user or admin user, I may want to view information on small screen width devices which do not lend themselves to displaying data in tabular form.

2. As a user or admin user, I want to confirm any delete action that results in the permanet removal of information from the data base.

### 1.3 Design 

- #### Colour scheme 

    The three colours that are used for the radioactive inventory website chosen not to detract from the important information that is presented.

    - **Light yellow** is used for the background to provide contrast for the blue **[Marterialize](https://materializecss.com/cards.html)** cards 

    - **Mid Blue** is used for the header and footer. 

    - **Light Blue** is used for the card panels and these are further inset with **white** cards panels to provide a heading for the page of section and to focus in on the form or table dispayed. 

- #### Fonts

    Sans serif and cursive are the fallbacks in case the main font isnâ€™t being imported to the site correctly. 

- #### Icons

    In the project, icons are used that are provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). The Icons that are used have functional purposes such as the hamburger menu and social media icons. 

- #### Images

    The images used are provided by [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/).

- #### Tables

    As this website will predominently be utilised by individual from the scientific community, considerable use is made of tables. Scientists like to see information in tables so that they can see patterns of date.  **[Cloud Tables](https://cloudtables.com/)** provides an excelent free to use JQuery plugin for this purpose.
s
- #### Collapsibles

    Unfortunately tables do not render well on smaller screen devices and so use is made of the **[Collapsible](https://materializecss.com/collapsible.html)** provided by **Materialize**

<span id="info-architecture"></span>

### 1.4 Information architecture

![Information Architecture](readmeimg/datastructure.png)

The collections **source** and **user** provide the two main data repositories with collections **department**, **location**, **laboratories**, **encapsuationtype** and **security group** providing a repository for constant data.

The collection **source history** and **login history** provide a an activity log allowing admin users to determine which users have loaned sources and how frequently the site is being visited.

The collection **isotope** is considered to be semi permanent data. Over time changing usage patterns may result in some sources of specific isotope type being removed from circuation.

<span id="wireframes"></span>

### 1.5 Wire Frames

Wireframes are provide [here](readmeimg/WireFrame/datastructure.png) and are best examined inconjunction with the site navigation structure shown in section 1.6

<span id="navigation-structure"></span>

### 1.6 User Navigation Structure

![Navigation Structure](readmeimg/navStructure.png)

The navigation structure shown above is reflected in the side bar visible on small and medium screen width devices. 

<span id="features"></span>
