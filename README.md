<span id="isotope"></span>

![Portfolio website](readmeimg/isotope.jpg)

A university physics faculty is required to maintain stock of radioactive sources for teaching and research purposes.

While individule radioactive sources do not pose a risk to health of students using them, collectively and in the wrong hands they could become a danger to the student community and security risk.

It is therefore crutial that the scientific staff contol student or accademic staff usage of these radioactive sources.

<span id="ux-goals"></span>

### 1.1 Project goals 

- Develop a full-stack application that allows users to access a common dataset.
- Develop a full-stack site that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB.

- Creat a website where students and accademic staff can:
    - register and be approved to use radioactive sources
    - see and select a radioactive source from a list of available radioactive sources and submit a request to use one.

- Create a website through which scientific staff can:
    - manage radioactive source allocation to students and accademic staff
    - Create Read Update and Delete radioactive source characteristic details
     
- Creating a website that is:
    - Simple to understand and easy to navigate

7. As an user, I want the present activity of the source to be calculated and displayed so that I can confirm that it will be suitable for my work.

8. As a user, I want to create a request for a sources of the required type from the inventory of available sources and have my request approved.

9. As a user I want to delete my request prior to its approval if I change my mind regarding the type of source.

**Admin user goals:**

1. As an admin user I want a simple to setup procedure to permit others users to access the application.  

2. As an admin user, I want to approve user each registration request so that I can ensure that the correct Health and Safety briefing has been given.

3. As an admin user, I want to view the registration status of all other users.

4. As an admin user, I want to update the access rights of  other users to that of admin to create deputies

5. As an admin user, I want to suspend a user account to prevent a user from loaning more sources.

6. As an admin user, I want to permanently delete as user acccount, but only if the user has returned all loaned sources

7. As an admin user, I want to view the technical characteristices of all sources so that users can be advised on their selection.

8. As an admin user, I want to view the location of all sources on inventory to satisfy a security audit.

9. As an admin user, I want to create a new entry source entry with the same or different technical charateristc but with a unique serial number.

10. As an admin user, I want to update the technical characteristics of an existing source if there is an error either by selecting from the full inventory or by searching on the serial number.

11. As an admin user, I want to delete a source from the inventory either by selecting from the full inventory or by searching on the serial number, but only if that source has been returned to the inventory.

12. As an admin user, I want to view all the isotope types available

13. As an admin user I want to add isotope types and its respective half life to the list.

14. As an admin user I want to update information assocaited with an isotope.

15. As an admin user I want to delete isotope types, but only if all sources of that isotope type are not on loan.

16. As an admin user, I want to view the full history of source loans so that I can spot any patterns.

17. As an admin user, I want to view how many times a source has been loaned by isotope type so that I can dispose of sources that are not being loaned.

18. As an admin user, I want to view how user logins there have been on a given date so that I can assses how the service is being used.  

**Goals that would appeal to Scientists:**

1. As a scientist, I want to see information presented in a tabular form where possible so that I can spot patterns in the data.

**Goals that would appeal to the general user:** 

1. As a user or admin user, I may want to view information on small screen width devices which do not lend themselves to displaying data in tabular form.

2. As a user or admin user, I want to confirm any delete action that results in the permanet removal of information from the data base.

### 1.3 Design 

- #### Colour scheme 

    The three colours that are used for the radioactive inventory website chosen not to detract from the important information that is presented.

    - **Light yellow** is used for the background to provide contrast for the blue **[Marterialize](https://materializecss.com/cards.html)** cards 

    - **Mid Blue** is used for the header and footer. 

    - **Light Blue** is used for the card panels and these are further inset with **white** cards panels to provide a heading for the page of section and to focus in on the form or table dispayed. 

- #### Fonts

    Sans serif and cursive are the fallbacks in case the main font isnâ€™t being imported to the site correctly. 

- #### Icons

    In the project, icons are used that are provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). The Icons that are used have functional purposes such as the hamburger menu and social media icons. 

- #### Images

    The images used are provided by [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/).

- #### Tables

    As this website will predominently be utilised by individual from the scientific community, considerable use is made of tables. Scientists like to see information in tables so that they can see patterns of date.  **[Cloud Tables](https://cloudtables.com/)** provides an excelent free to use JQuery plugin for this purpose.
s
- #### Collapsibles

    Unfortunately tables do not render well on smaller screen devices and so use is made of the **[Collaspible](https://materializecss.com/collapsible.html)** provided by **Materialize**

<span id="info-architecture"></span>

### 1.4 Information architecture

![Information Architecture](readmeimg/datastructure.png)

The collections **source** and **user** provide the two main data repositories with collections **department**, **location**, **laboratories**, **encapsuationtype** and **security group** providing a repository for constant data.

The collection **source history** and **login history** provide a an activity log allowing admin users to determine which users have loaned sources and how frequently the site is being visited.

The collection **isotope** is considered to be semi permanent data. Over time changing usage patterns may result in some sources of specific isotope type being removed from circuation.

<span id="wireframes"></span>

### 1.5 Wire Frames

Wireframes are provide [here](readmeimg/WireFrame/datastructure.png) and are best examined inconjunction with the site navigation structure shown in section 1.6

<span id="navigation-structure"></span>

### 1.6 User Navigation Structure

![Navigation Structure](readmeimg/navStructure.png)

The navigation structure shown above is reflected in the side bar visible on small and medium screen width devices. 

<span id="features"></span>

## 2.0 Features

<span id="features-existing"></span>

### 2.1 Features implemented

#### General

- Where information is presented in a tabular for for large screen devices, it is then also presented as collapsible for small screen devices.

#### Users:
- Users must first register to use the service and users accounts must be approved by an admin user.

- A user may search the database for a source type and may request its loan. Only sources that are available will be presented. 

- The user may delete the loan request if this has not been approved

- A user may change their password, select another department or enter an new research group.

- A user may view a list of the sources he/she has on loan

#### Admin:

- An admin user must first register as a user.

- An admin user must be promotes to admin status by another admin user.

- An admin user may **suspend** a users account and subsequently reistate it 

- An admin user may delete a user account, but only is the user has returned all sources loaned by him/her.

- An admin user may approve a source load or identify it as returned 

- An admin user may view a full history of source loaned to users as well as key statistics on the number of sources of a particular isotope available, user logins per day and source loaned by serial number.

- An admin user may view the full table of sources available in the inventory and from the table update or delete a source. Note that a source may not be deleted if it is on loan.

- An admin user may create, update or delete a source from the inventory. A source may not be deleted from inventory unless it is identified as returned.

- An admin user may view the list of isotopes types available.

- An admin user may add and update delete an isotope type. Deletion is only possible where sources of that isotope type have been returned to the inventory.

<span id="features-future"></span>

### 2.1 Features for furture implementation

- The current implementation is restricted to the creation, read, update and deletion of isotope types only. A future revision could be expanded to include more setting such as laboratory location and source encapsulation type.

- The current implementation does not include a calcuation for source dose. Future implementation could reference dose tables and provide this calculation.

- A future implementation could include the sending of emails to inform users that their accounts or requests sources have been approved
