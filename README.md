![Portfolio website](readmeimg/isotope.jpg)

A university physics faculty is required to maintain stock of radioactive sources for teaching and research purposes.

While individule radioactive sources do not pose a risk to health of students using them, collectively and in the wrong hands they could become a danger to the student community and security risk.

It is therefore crutial that the scientific staff contol student or accademic usage of these radioactive sources.

### 1.1 Project goals 

- Develop a full-stack application that allows users to access a common dataset.
- Develop a full-stack site that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB.

- Creat a website where students and accademic staff can:
    - register and be approved to use radioactive sources
    - see and select a radioactive source from a list of available radioactive sources and submit a request to use one.

- Create a website through which scientific staff can:
    - manage radioactive source allocation to students and accademic staff
    - Create Read Update and Delete radioactive source characteristic details
     
- Creating a website that is:
    - Simple to understand and easy to navigate
    - Presents different levels of access to information for students/accademics and scientific staff.
